A blog creation for a writer / Openclassrooms France

Hi!

This is a project for the school Openclassrooms (France), the 4th of the Web Developer Junior's Formation. I need to create a blog for a writer based on a CRUD, using PHP and a MVC architecture, only the model in POO required. The writer can post a new chapter using the API TinyMCE, and every post can be comment by a reader.
